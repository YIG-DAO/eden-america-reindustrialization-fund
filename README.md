# American Reindustrialization Fund

## Overview

The American Reindustrialization Fund tracks companies at the forefront of reshoring critical manufacturing, energy production, and technological capabilities to the United States. This initiative focuses on strengthening domestic supply chains, enhancing national security, and establishing technological sovereignty in key strategic sectors.

## Portfolio Structure

The fund's holdings are maintained in [`portfolio.json`](./portfolio.json), organized by strategic sectors including quantum computing, semiconductor manufacturing, space technology, and advanced energy. The structure reflects our thesis that American industrial and technological leadership requires excellence across multiple interconnected domains.

## Investment Thesis

### Strategic Imperative

The United States faces a critical juncture in maintaining its technological and industrial leadership. Decades of offshoring have created vulnerabilities in supply chains and diminished manufacturing capabilities. The American Reindustrialization thesis focuses on companies working to reverse this trend through:

- Advanced Manufacturing: Reshoring critical manufacturing capabilities using automation, robotics, and AI
- Energy Independence: Developing next-generation nuclear, renewable, and traditional energy resources
- Technological Sovereignty: Building domestic capabilities in semiconductors, quantum computing, and AI
- Space Infrastructure: Establishing U.S. leadership in space technology and satellite infrastructure
- Critical Materials: Securing supply chains for rare earth elements and strategic materials

### Key Sectors

#### Quantum Computing & Advanced Computing
American leadership in quantum computing represents a strategic imperative for maintaining technological advantages in cryptography, materials science, and complex systems modeling.

#### Energy Security
A robust domestic energy sector combining traditional resources with next-generation nuclear and renewable technologies ensures economic stability and strategic independence.

#### Deep Tech & Artificial Intelligence
AI and deep tech capabilities are fundamental to maintaining competitive advantages in automation, data processing, and advanced manufacturing.

#### Space Technology
Space represents both a strategic domain and a commercial frontier, with applications ranging from communications to Earth observation and defense.

#### Critical Manufacturing
Reshoring advanced manufacturing capabilities ensures supply chain resilience and maintains strategic industrial capabilities within U.S. borders.
